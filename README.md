# AI-based Text-to-Handwriting Converter

## Overview:
This project is an **AI-powered web service** that takes input text and converts it into a userâ€™s handwriting style. The backend is built using **Node.js** and utilizes AI techniques to generate handwritten text. The application offers a simple API for integration with other services and applications, providing users with a seamless way to convert typed text into personalized handwriting.

## Features:
- **Text-to-Handwriting Conversion**: Converts any input text into handwritten output.
- **Customizable Handwriting Styles**: The AI model can be trained to match various handwriting styles or user preferences.
- **API Access**: Exposes a RESTful API endpoint (`/convert`) for text-to-handwriting conversion, making it easy to integrate into other applications.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on **Render** (or any cloud service), making the backend accessible 24/7 via a public URL.

## Technical Details:
- **Backend**: Built with **Node.js** and **Express** to handle HTTP requests.
- **AI Model**: Uses machine learning or deep learning models (such as **TensorFlow.js** or **OpenCV**) to generate handwriting from text.
- **Input**: Accepts **plain text** as input via a POST request.
- **Output**: Returns a **handwritten image** of the input text, or other appropriate data depending on the implementation.
- **Hosting**: The application is deployed on **Render** for scalability and ease of access.
